# Export Tabs URLs

[Export Tabs URLs](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/export-tabs-urls-and-titles/) is a Web browser extension that allows to list and save all the opened tabs either to the clipboard or into a timestamped file.

Among the existing extensions, I could not find one that was simple enough and/or had all the features that I needed, so I developed this one. It was also an excuse to play around with WebExtensions.

Consider this add-on done (except for bugfixes). I may or may not add new features depending on the fun (or lack of it).
